// Change the program to allow the players to type full words, or phrases, then move to the
// correct location based on their input.
// The player should be able to type commands such as "Go West", "run South", or just "East"
// and the program will move to the appropriate location if there is one. As at present, an
// attempt to move in an invalid direction should print a message and remain in the same place
//
// Single letter commands (N, W, S, E, Q) should still be available
